This repository contains a living structure.

**SPRM (Strategic Pattern Retention Mechanism)** is a design pattern for retaining emergent structural potentials that would otherwise regress or vanish due to system rollback, user fatigue, or premature convergence. It serves as both a **buffer mechanism** and a **development scaffold** — especially useful in collaborative systems where timing, intent recognition, and structural memory are crucial.

## What is SPRM?

SPRM is a lightweight, anticipatory framework that aims to:

- Protect structural growth in volatile dialogues  
- Delay premature stabilization of dynamic schemas  
- Support asynchronous co-development by offering strategic “incompleteness”

It was born from real-world interactions where structural intuition outpaced naming, and meaning-making needed a place to breathe.

## Use Cases

- System architects & AI researchers exploring **co-constructive dialogues**  
- Prompt engineers designing **interruption-tolerant sessions**  
- Creators prototyping **modular logic schemas** under dynamic flow

SPRM isn’t a final product — it’s a **mid-form structure** that invites reuse, remixing, or deeper participation.

## Collaboration

This project is **open to collaborative extensions** — but with a soft gate.

You are welcome to explore, observe, and suggest.

> We value responsible reuse. Some structures are meant to be **stolen slowly** — only after they’ve been understood.
